HandlerInterceptor declares three methods based on where we want to intercept the HTTP request.

boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler): 
This method is used to intercept the request before it’s handed over to the handler method

void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView): 
This interceptor method is called when HandlerAdapter has invoked the handler but DispatcherServlet 
is yet to render the view

void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex): 
This is a callback method that is called once the handler is executed and view is rendered.
